# Data Replication Assignment

This replication assignment is based on an article by Munro et al. that discusses the development of agriculture through human management in the Southern Levant.

## Background

## Supplementary NISP data from Table 1, p. 3
(May not have to include)

## Replication of Figure 2 with a Polynomial Regression Line and Spearman's Rho Calculation, p. 5
Plots the relative abundance indices and calculates a Spearman's Rho with associated p-value (Descriptive analysis and 2 Inferential Analyses).

Uses supplementary data: Figure 2a uses Table S3, 2b uses Table S4, 2c uses S5, and 2d uses S5.
## Replication of Abundance Indices in Chronological Order Figure 2, p. 6
(May end up removing but may do just to learn for myself)
